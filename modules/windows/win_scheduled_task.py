module: win_scheduled_task
version_added: "2.0"
short_description: Manage scheduled tasks
description:
- Creates/modified or removes Windows scheduled tasks.
notes:
- In Ansible 2.4 and earlier, this could only be run on Server 2012/Windows 8
  or newer. Since 2.5 this restriction has been lifted.
- The option names and structure for actions and triggers of a service follow
  the C(RegisteredTask) naming standard and requirements, it would be useful to
  read up on this guide if coming across any issues U(https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa382542.aspx).

      a task this can be a null or an empty list.
    - The ordering of this list is important, the module will ensure the order
      is kept when modifying the task.
